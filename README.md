## Model architecture

DSCF model is a hierarchical local attention encoder-decoder transformer. The detailed components of the model are described in DSCF_model_pe.py.
The following image is the general outline of the general pre-trained model.
The pre-trained weights of the tiny-version model are open source and can be downloaded at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KemTI4yx2-6SwKzmSYyROQ?pwd=ira8. The weights of larger models will also be open-source after publishing.

## Preprocessing

Paraffin removal is a general routine in FFPE IR analysis. DSCF model can be tailored for paraffin removal. The following images are results of raw data, paraffin and paraffin-removed data.
